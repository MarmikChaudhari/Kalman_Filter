# Kalman_Filter
Kalman Filter from ground up in python. 
Using numpy python library for arrays, matrices and operations on them, I implemented a Kalman filter that estimates velocity from position measurements. 
The getMeasurement() function is used to simulate a sensor providing real-time position measurements of a performance automobile as it races down a flat road with a constant velocity of 60 m/s.
